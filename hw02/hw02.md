# Homework 02: Higher Order Functions

## 1. Instructions

> Please download homework materials `hw02.zip` from our QQ group if you don't have one.

In this homework, you are required to complete the problems described in section 2. The starter code for these problems is provided in `hw02.py`, which is distributed as part of the homework materials in the `code` directory.

We have also prepared an optional problem just for fun in section 3. You can find further descriptions there.

**Submission**: When you are done, submit your code to our [OJ website](http://114.212.84.18) as instructed in lab00. You may submit more than once before the deadline; only the final submission will be scored. See lab00 for more instructions on submitting assignments.

**Readings**: You might find the following references to the textbook useful:
- [Section 1.6](http://composingprograms.com/pages/16-higher-order-functions.html)


> The `construct_check` module in `code/construct_check.py` is used in this assignment, which defines the function `check`. For example, a call such as
>
>     check("foo.py", "func1", ["While", "For", "Recursion"])
>
> checks that the function `func1` in file `foo.py` does not contain any `while` or `for` constructs, and is not an overtly recursive function (i.e., one in which a function contains a call to itself by name). Note that this restriction does not apply to all problems in this assignment. If this restriction applies, you will see a call to `check` somewhere in the problem's doctests.

## 2. Required Problems

In this section, you are required to complete the problems below and submit your code to `Contest hw02` in our [OJ website](http://114.212.84.18) as instructed in lab00 to get your answer scored.

Several doctests refer to these functions:

```python
from operator import add, mul, sub

square = lambda x: x * x

identity = lambda x: x

triple = lambda x: 3 * x

increment = lambda x: x + 1
```

### Problem 1: Compose Function (50pts)
Define a function `compose` so that `compose(h, g)(x)` returns `h(g(x))`. That is, `compose(h, g)` returns another function a function `f`, such that `f(x) = h(g(x))`.

```python
def compose(h, g):
    """Return a function f, such that f(x) = h(g(x)).

    >>> compose(square, triple)(5)
    225
    >>> double_inc = compose(increment, increment)
    >>> double_inc(3)
    5
    >>> double_inc(4)
    6
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Remember to use doctest to test your code:

    $ python -m doctest hw02.py

### Problem 2: Product (100pts)

The `summation(n, f)` function from the higher-order functions lecture adds up `f(1) + ... + f(n)`. Write a similar function called `product` that returns `f(1) * ... * f(n)`.

```python
def product(n, f):
    """Return the product of the first n terms in a sequence.
    n -- a positive integer
    f -- a function that takes one argument to produce the term

    >>> product(3, identity)  # 1 * 2 * 3
    6
    >>> product(5, identity)  # 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
    120
    >>> product(3, square)    # 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2
    36
    >>> product(5, square)    # 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2 * 4^2 * 5^2
    14400
    >>> product(3, increment) # (1+1) * (2+1) * (3+1)
    24
    >>> product(3, triple)    # 1*3 * 2*3 * 3*3
    162
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

### Problem 3: Accumulate (150pts)

Let's take a look at how `summation` and `product` are instances of a more general function called `accumulate`:

```python
def accumulate(combiner, base, n, f):
    """Return the result of combining the first n terms in a sequence and base.
    The terms to be combined are f(1), f(2), ..., f(n).  combiner is a
    two-argument commutative, associative function.

    >>> accumulate(add, 0, 5, identity)  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    15
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 5, identity) # 11 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
    26
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 0, identity) # 11
    11
    >>> accumulate(add, 11, 3, square)   # 11 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2
    25
    >>> accumulate(mul, 2, 3, square)    # 2 * 1^2 * 2^2 * 3^2
    72
    >>> accumulate(lambda x, y: x + y + 1, 2, 3, square)
    19
    >>> accumulate(lambda x, y: (x + y) % 17, 19, 20, square)
    16
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

`accumulate` has the following parameters:

- `f` and `n`: the same parameters as in `summation` and `product`
- `combiner`: a two-argument function that specifies how the current term is combined with the previously accumulated terms.
- `base`: value at which to start the accumulation.

For example, the result of `accumulate(add, 11, 3, square)` is

    11 + square(1) + square(2) + square(3) = 25

> Note: You may assume that `combiner` is associative and commutative. That is, `combiner(a, combiner(b, c)) == combiner(combiner(a, b), c)` and `combiner(a, b) == combiner(b, a)` for all `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, you may not assume `combiner` is chosen from a fixed function set and hard-code the solution.

After implementing `accumulate`, show how `summation` and `product` can both be defined as simple calls to `accumulate`:

```python
def summation_using_accumulate(n, f):
    """Returns the sum of f(1) + ... + f(n). The implementation
    uses accumulate.

    >>> summation_using_accumulate(5, square)
    55
    >>> summation_using_accumulate(5, triple)
    45
    >>> from construct_check import check
    >>> # ban iteration and recursion
    >>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'summation_using_accumulate',
    ...       ['Recursion', 'For', 'While'])
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def product_using_accumulate(n, f):
    """An implementation of product using accumulate.

    >>> product_using_accumulate(4, square)
    576
    >>> product_using_accumulate(6, triple)
    524880
    >>> from construct_check import check
    >>> # ban iteration and recursion
    >>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'product_using_accumulate',
    ...       ['Recursion', 'For', 'While'])
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

### Problem 4: Make Repeater (100pts)

Implement the function `make_repeater` so that `make_repeater(h, n)(x)` returns `h(h(...h(x)...))`, where `h` is applied `n` times. That is, `make_repeater(h, n)` returns another function that can then be applied to another argument. For example, `make_repeater(square, 3)(42)` evaluates to `square(square(square(42)))`.

```python
def make_repeater(h, n):
    """Return the function that computes the nth application of h.

    >>> add_three = make_repeater(increment, 3)
    >>> add_three(5)
    8
    >>> make_repeater(triple, 5)(1) # 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 1
    243
    >>> make_repeater(square, 2)(5) # square(square(5))
    625
    >>> make_repeater(square, 4)(5) # square(square(square(square(5))))
    152587890625
    >>> make_repeater(square, 0)(5) # Yes, it makes sense to apply the function zero times!
    5
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

> For an extra challenge, try defining `make_repeater` in a single one-line return statement using your `compose` function (defined in problem 1) and your `accumulate` function (defined in problem 3).

## 3. Just for fun Problems

This section is out of scope for our course, so the problems below is optional. That is, the problems in this section **don't** count for your final score and **don't** have any deadline. Do it at any time if you want an extra challenge or some practice with high order function and abstraction!

To check the correctness of your answer, you can submit your code to `Contest 'Just for fun'` in our [OJ website](http://114.212.84.18) as instructed in lab00.

### Problem 5: Church numerals (Optional)

The logician Alonzo Church invented a system of representing non-negative integers entirely using functions. The purpose was to show that functions are sufficient to describe all of number theory: if we have functions, we do not need to assume that numbers exist, but instead we can invent them.

Your goal in this problem is to rediscover this representation known as *Church numerals*. Here are the definitions of `zero`, as well as a function that returns one more than its argument:

```python
def zero(f):
    return lambda x: x

def successor(n):
    return lambda f: lambda x: f(n(f)(x))
```

First, define functions `one` and `two` such that they have the same behavior as `successor(zero)` and `successor(successor(zero))` respectively, but do not call `successor` in your implementation.

Next, implement a function `church_to_int` that converts a church numeral argument to a regular Python integer.

Finally, implement functions `add_church`, `mul_church`, and `pow_church` that perform addition, multiplication, and exponentiation on church numerals.

```python
def one(f):
    """Church numeral 1: same as successor(zero)"""
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def two(f):
    """Church numeral 2: same as successor(successor(zero))"""
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

three = successor(two)

def church_to_int(n):
    """Convert the Church numeral n to a Python integer.

    >>> church_to_int(zero)
    0
    >>> church_to_int(one)
    1
    >>> church_to_int(two)
    2
    >>> church_to_int(three)
    3
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def add_church(m, n):
    """Return the Church numeral for m + n, for Church numerals m and n.

    >>> church_to_int(add_church(two, three))
    5
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def mul_church(m, n):
    """Return the Church numeral for m * n, for Church numerals m and n.

    >>> four = successor(three)
    >>> church_to_int(mul_church(two, three))
    6
    >>> church_to_int(mul_church(three, four))
    12
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def pow_church(m, n):
    """Return the Church numeral m ** n, for Church numerals m and n.

    >>> church_to_int(pow_church(two, three))
    8
    >>> church_to_int(pow_church(three, two))
    9
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```
